      We collect data you provide us when you contact us (eg. through the

      Furthermore we collect data anonymized through Google Analytics (see 3.).
      We do not collect any personal data.<br />

      collected automatically to improve your website experience.

      the necessity every year - furthermore, the legal archiving obligations
      apply. No data is transferred to third parties.<br />
