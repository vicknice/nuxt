Victor Tolbert

Hey, I am Victor Tolbert, a fanatical full-time open sourceror.

Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. Check out my full projects list here. I have started a 100 day challenge about design, compform, interactivity and experimenting new things on 100.victortolbert.com.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. Some of my photos can be found on Instagram. If you happended to be in the same city I live (currently in Atlanta), maybe we can hang out and take some photos (or code of course) together.

Find me on GitHub and Twitter, mail me at hi@victortolbert.com.

If you like my work, consider sponsoring me on GitHub Sponsor to keep them sustainable.
