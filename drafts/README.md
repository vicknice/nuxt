## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See
[deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live
system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env
running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a
little demo.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## Storybook

Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier
by isolating components.

### What's a Story

A story captures the rendered state of a UI component. Developers write multiple
stories per component that describe all the “interesting” states a component can
support. It’s a function that returns a component’s state given a set of
arguments.

Storybook uses the generic term arguments (args for short) when talking about
React’s [props], Vue’s [slots], Angular’s [@input], and other similar concepts.
