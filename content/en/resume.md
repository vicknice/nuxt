## About the Company

FullCalendar LLC develops and sells the internet’s most widely-used web-based calendar software. Our product is a front-end developer library with over 1 million downloads per month. It's released under a hybrid open-source / premium license. You’ll be joining a small agile team that values pragmatism and flexibility over process and fixed schedules.

## About the Role

You’ll take sole responsibility over the following vital parts of the business:

- **Public Website** - attracts customers, educates them on the product
- **Internal Tools** - makes our managers and support reps more productive

We are looking for a skilled front-end developer. This role is different from many other developer roles in the following ways:

- **Projects will be well-defined** and requirements won’t change drastically. Your “PM” will be a seasoned developer who understands and respects the development process.

- **Your graphic design skills will matter.** While each project’s functionality will be well-defined, many aspects of the graphic design will be improvised by you, especially when it comes to responsive layouts.

- **You’ll work with fresh codebases.** No more wading through massive amounts of legacy code. However, you will be rewriting and porting over content from other codebases.

- **You’ll be mentored** by some pretty influential open source developers who maintain the core FullCalendar project.


## Projects

You'll be working on the following [fun] projects:

- **Internal Admin UI** for tasks related to customers, licenses, and renewals. Heavily used by sales/support. Will be accessed as a standalone web page as well as a sized-down iframe embedded within our CRM and support systems. Rewrite/redesign of an existing system.
- **Issue Tracker Visualizer** for sorting, grouping, and displaying stats for feature and bug tickets. Used internally for task prioritization. Also visible on the public website. A rewrite/redesign of an existing system.
- **Moving the entire public website to Docusaurus** or other React-based documentation-friendly static-ish website framework. The tedious process of porting over individual docs will be done by the core developers.
- **System for runnable code samples.** For displaying JS/React/Vue/Angular code samples in each article of the docs that can be opened up in a code playground like Codepen.
- **A supercharged demos page.** We intend to wow customers with a large library of interactive demos. This will likely be based on whatever system you devise in the previous project. Overhaul of an existing page.
- **Writing individual code samples** for FullCalendar's docs. This ongoing task may seem a bit tedious, but it will teach you about our core product’s API.

## Location, Hours, and Compensation

You’ll be a full-time remote contractor working flexible hours.

Pay is between $35 - $40 / hour, depending on experience and location.

## Experience

You'll need existing experience in the following areas:

- JavaScript (highly proficient)
- React (highly proficient)
- HTML/CSS (highly proficient)
- Responsive design techniques
- Static site generators (like Next.js) and JAM stack
- Build systems (like Webpack)
- Git
- Bash scripting and sysadmin basics
