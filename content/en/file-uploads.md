For most situations using S3 is a no brainer, but the majority of developers
transfer their user’s uploads to S3 after they have received them on the server
side. This doesn’t have to be the case, your user’s web browser can send the
file directly to an S3 bucket. You don’t even have to open the bucket up to the
public. Signed upload requests with an expiry will allow temporary access to
upload a single object.

Doing this has two distinct advantages: you don’t need to complicate your server
configuration to handle file uploads, and your users will likely get a better
user experience by uploading straight to S3 instead of “proxying” through your
web server.

## Generating the upload request

```php
// These options specify which bucket to upload to, and what the object key should start with.
// In this case, the key can be anything, and will assume the name of the file being uploaded.
$options = [
    ['bucket' => 'bucket-name'],
    ['starts-with', '$key', '']
];

$postObject = new PostObjectV4(
    $this->client, // The Aws\S3\S3Client instance.
    'bucket-name', // The bucket to upload to.
    [], // Any additional form inputs, they don't apply here.
    $options,
    '+1 minute' // How long the client has to start uploading the file.
);

$formAttributes = $postObject->getFormAttributes();
$formData = $postObject->getFormInputs();
?>
```

The above snippet will give you a collection of form attributes and form inputs
that you should use to construct your upload request to S3. The
`$formAttributes` variable will have an action, a method and an enctype to add
to your HTML form element. The `$formData` variable will hold an array of form
inputs that you should be POSTing along to S3.

m inputs that you should be POSTing along to S3.

Your user’s browser can then start uploading a file to the URL contained in
`$formAttributes['action']`, and it will upload directly into your bucket
without touching the server. It’s very important to set a sensible expiry on a
presigned request, and it’s also important to know that specifying `+1 minute`
means that your user will have one minute in which to start sending the file, if
the file takes 30 minutes to upload, their connection will not be closed.

There is, however, some bucket setup that you need to do. Due to our age-old
enemy CORS your user will not be allowed access to upload straight to a bucket
because they’ll be uploading from another domain. Fixing this is simple. Under
your bucket properties in the AWS console, under the “Permissions” section,
click the “Edit CORS Configuration” button.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
    </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

Our user’s browser will first be sending an `OPTIONS` request to the presigned
URL, followed by a `POST` request.

```html
<core-input
  v-model.trim="form.fileName"
  :label="$t('file_name')"
  :placeholder="$t('file_name_placeholder')"
  required
></core-input>
```

```html
<h2>File Information</h2>
<pre>{{ selectedFile ? selectedFile.name : '' }}</pre>

<div>
  <drop-zone
    id="foo"
    ref="foo"
    :options="dropzoneOptions"
    :destroy-dropzone="true"
  ></drop-zone>

  <button
    class="inline-flex items-center px-4 py-1 border rounded shadow"
    @click="upload"
    type="button"
  >
    Upload File
  </button>
</div>
```

### Version 2

```js
import AWS from 'aws-sdk'
import S3 from 'aws-sdk/clients/S3'

const multipartUpload = new AWS.S3.ManagedUpload({
  params: {Bucket: 'bucket', Key: 'key', Body: stream},
