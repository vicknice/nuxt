## Our History

Yeah... we have been around for a while, gaining a lot of experience dealing
with the public health monsters on local, state, and federal levels. Here are
some of the highlights!

- 2008- Ben Gleason and Marcus Bouligny found the Prospectus Group with a vision
  to empower communities with current and relevant information, tools, and
  research. Together, they bring 15 years of experience, expertise, and
  commitment to public health.
- 2008 - Progroup teams with Center for the Application of Prevention
  Technologies (CAPT) to provide training to states and communities. Progroup
  teams become master trainers for the national curriculum Substance Abuse
  Prevention Skills Training (SAPST).
- 2008 - First version of Ecco was developed with one function: Track and
  provide notes on Technical Assistance events.
- 2009 - Ecco Version 2 launches with advanced features, most notably, external
  user sign on and notes.
- 2010 - Ecco Version 3 launches with the ability to capture public health
  implementation plans from contracted prevention providers in the field
- 2010 - 2014 - Ecco Version 4 goes through a multitude of looks and feature
  updates focused on making a better user experience.
- 2016 - Ben Gleason completes PhD program and Prospectus re-organizes,
  officially opening its research division. Ben Gleason leads a team that puts
  together tools that help public health practitioners become more effective.
- 2015 - 2016 - Prospectus looks into gaining a better understanding about why
  prevention providers struggle entering process data on prevention programs.
  Prospectus conducts focus groups and interviews with prevention providers. The
  inquiry yields important, valuable information about the challenges to
  gathering process data. Some takeaways: Data entry systems often ask redundant
  questions and don’t offer the ability to pull report data in a flexible and
  useful way.
- 2016 - 2017 - Using information gathered from the focus groups and key
  informant interviews Prospectus expands Ecco to include the gathering and
  reporting of process level data, providing one touch and custom reporting
  options for clients as well as a streamlined process for entering data at the
  provider level. Launching Ecco as an Electronic Records System (ERS).
- 2018 - Progroup expands Ecco once again to help contract administration for
  Title 4e Programs for the state of Georgia, through Georgia State University.
