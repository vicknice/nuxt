title: Adoption Grants
---

**Promise686 offers two types of adoption grants, Adoption Matching Grants and
Legal Grants**. We believe that by decreasing the financial burden of adoption,
more families are able to adopt and more children are placed in loving families.

### Adoption Matching Grants

Adoption Matching Grants are awarded $500 – $4000 for a one child adoption and
$500 – $6000 for the adoption of more than one child. Families fundraise for
their adoption within their sphere of influence, typically using letters,
emails, or face-to-face meetings. **Promise686** matches their funds raised
dollar-for-dollar up to the grant amount. Monies raised over the grant amount
also go toward the family’s adoption expenses. Families access these funds to
pay legitimate adoption expenses. Per IRS guidelines, **Promise686** must
maintain complete discretion and control over use of all donated funds, but
strives to honor the donor’s preferences in all cases.

We believe that the matching grant program also encourages community-building
since the adopting family reaches out to their friends and family to raise
support beyond necessary finances. In addition to raising needed funds, we
believe this approach builds an “adoption team” for the family. This team may
support the family through financial donations toward adoption expenses but also
provide strength in prayer, encouragement, and post-adoption support.

### Legal Grants

Legal Grants are offered to offset the legal costs of adoption such as in the
case of the domestication of a foreign adoption. These are legal costs that are
separate from the fees paid to an adoption agency or the agency’s attorney.
**Promise686** maintains a preferred relationship with Christina Bennett, LLC
and sends all grant recipients to this firm

## Grant Application Process:

**Promise686** maintains the following prerequisites for grant applicants:

- Applicants must live in the state of Georgia.
- The family’s adoption home study must be complete with a favorable
  recommendation from a licensed 501(c)(3) adoption agency.
- Applicants (both husband and wife) must be members in good standing within a
  Christian church adhering to the
  [Nicene Creed](https://promise686.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Nicene-Creed.pdf).
- Applicants must be utilizing a non-profit adoption agency.

**To request a Grant Application**, fill out this short
[pre-approval application](https://www.tfaforms.com/435236).

- Applications are due on the first of every other month – January, March, May,
  July, September, and November.

Promise686’s Grant Committee reviews the applications for each grant cycle and
invites families under consideration to be interviewed in person or via Skype.
Face to face interviews typically takes place in the Johns Creek, GA area. Grant
decisions are communicated within six weeks of the application deadline.

Many families who receive Adoption Matching Grants may later apply for a Legal
Grant. In this case, families complete a short application designed for this
situation. If funds are available in a grant cycle and the adoption attorney
confirms that there is no conflict of interest, families who have been approved
for an Adoption Matching Grant are approved for a Legal Grant.

## Would you like to fund an adoption?

\*A **$5,000 gift** _typically_ funds the cost of one adoption, bringing a child
home forever, because families will match your gift through their network of
friends and typically surpass the initial match. You can either fund an entire
adoption or give a partial amount here:
