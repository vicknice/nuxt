title: Prayer

We believe that prayer is critical in everything we do and is essential for families and individuals involved in volunteering, fostering, or adopting. Once involved, prayer will feel all the more necessary. Loving any child, especially those who have experienced trauma, is often difficult and prayer for wisdom becomes as natural as breathing!

We would be honored to pray for you at our weekly staff meetings and at a monthly larger prayer time with volunteers. We invite you to send your prayer requests to prayer@promise686.org.

(Please note that a small group of staff and volunteers will view your prayer request so please share details with this in mind.)
