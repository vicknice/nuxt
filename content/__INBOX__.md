## Glossary

### Cardinality

The number of elements in a set or other grouping, as a property of that
grouping.

If A has only a finite number of elements, its **cardinality** is simply the
number of elements in A. For **example**, if `A={2,4,6,8,10}`, then `|A|=5`.

When applied to databases, the meaning is a bit different: it’s **the number of
distinct values in a table column, relative to the number of rows in the
table.**

Repeated values in the column don’t count.

- **data cardinality**—how many distinct values are in a column relationship
- **cardinality**—whether a relationship is one-to-one, many-to-one, or
  many-to-many
- **high cardinality**—a lot of different values

### Skills / Learning / Current Interest

- Authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Design systems
- Docker and Docker Compose
- End to end testing with Cypress
- Get more familiar with Charles, Paw, Postman or Insomnia
- GraphQL (I have mostly done Restful APIs at this point)
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
- Unit testing with React Testing Library
- XState: a state management library

## Features

- A set of interconnected patterns & practices for you and your team.
- A well thought-out terminology, naming conventions, and hierarchy.
- Get an automated overview of how your design system progresses over time.
- Global design tokens in YAML format that you can use inside any component.
- Automatic generation of living, user editable documentation.
- Easily export and use your Design System as an NPM dependency in another
  project.
- Create a token, an element, or a pattern, and it’s immediately available
  across all components.
- Pre-configured Prettier setup for auto-formatting code on both save and before
  commit.
- Documentation and the app logic are separated, so you can have public docs
  while the app itself stays private.

### Unique preview URLs

Each commit gets its own unique URL. Preview URLs make it easier to get
meaningful code reviews without the overhead of pulling down the branch. They
also make it easier to get feedback from PMs, designers and marketers on the
latest iteration, bridging the gap between mocks and code.

### Infinite staging

“Does anyone mind if I take over staging?” might also sound like a familiar
question. Each feature branch will have its own dedicated consistent alias,
allowing you to have a consistent URL for the latest changes.

With Preview and Production environments, all feature branches and preview links
will be built with preview variables, so you can experiment without impacting
production data.

When you’re ready to deploy to production, we’ll redeploy to production for you
with the updated production environment variables.

## Core / Foundation

Frontier Design System provides you and your team a set of organized tools,
patterns & practices. It works as the foundation for your application
development

- Design Tokens
  - Color
  - Fonts
  - Typography
  - Iconography
  - Spacing
  - Sizing
- [Elements][elements]
- [Patterns][patterns]
- [Templates][templates]
- Page Examples


## Terminology

- **Principles** are the foundation of the whole system. They form the basis of
  a good product and help the team with decision making. They are there to guide
  you and your team when working with the myriad parts of the system and help
  you do better and more informed decisions.
- **Design Tokens** are the atoms of the system as [Salesforce]() describes
  them. In Vue Design System they are used instead of hard coded values to
  ensure a better consistency across any platform.
- **Elements** utilize decisions made on the token level. A simple example of an
  element would be a button, a link, or an input. Anything that cannot be broken
  down further. I use the name ‘element’ since everything in Vue and React world
  is nowadays ‘a component.’ Using that term for anything else would be
  confusing.
- **Patterns** are UI Patterns that fall on the more complex side of the
  spectrum. So for example things like a date picker, a data table, or a
  visualization. Patterns utilize both elements and tokens. If you wonder
  whether something should be called an element or a pattern, ask yourself this
  question: _“Can this be broken down into smaller pieces?”_ If the answer is
  yes, it should most likely be a pattern in Vue Design System.
- **Templates** exist to document the layout and structure of a section. I am
  not calling these pages since semantically that would be incorrect. While they
  can be pages, that’s not their only functionality. Templates consist of the
  three things mentioned above: _tokens_, _elements_, and _patterns_.
