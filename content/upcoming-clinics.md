## Make a difference in the lives of vulnerable children

### Church Advocate Clinics

Learn how to care for at-risk kids and their families through a step-by-step model called **Family Advocacy Ministries (FAMs)**. FAMs create _much-needed_ support for foster & adoptive families and biological families in crisis. During this Clinic, we’ll equip you on how to build and lead a successful FAM, _with a focus on foster care_, within your local church **so you can help provide what vulnerable children need most––_strong families_**.

> “As I came to this clinic, I felt overwhelmed with wanting to start something at my church but not knowing exactly what it would look like or where to start … but this is IT! God put this vision in my heart, and now holding the blueprints to help it come together is a true gift. Also, Catie and Jessi were amazing! They did a great job teaching and interacting with just a computer screen. I was super impressed! The resources you have to offer to launch a FAM are amazing. It is SO good to not have to reinvent the wheel. Thank you!” – Church Advocate & Clinic Graduate, Virtual Clinic

> “I just want to say how much I appreciate Promise686. It was such a blessing to find out that the vision God put in my heart already existed with an amazing support system already in place to back it up. I never imagined that I would have not only the tools I need for an effective ministry at my fingertips, but also a personal mentor and support coach to make sure our ministry is successful. Promise686 has been a dream come true. I cannot imagine how much time and energy it would take for me if I were on my own. By simply attending a training I feel ready and equipped to immediately start a ministry that can effectively serve the people of our church. Thank you, thank you, thank you… for being so available.”c– Church Advocate & Clinic Graduate, Beaufort, SC
