benefits:
  - '**Quality**: Verify that UIs work in different scenarios by building components in isolation and defining their relevant states.'
  - "**Durability**: Pinpoint bugs down to the detail by testing at the component level. It’s less work and more precise than testing screens."
  - '**Speed**: Assemble UIs faster by reusing existing components from a component library or design system.'
  - '**Efficiency**: Parallelize development and design by decomposing UI into discrete components then sharing the load between different team members.'
not_component_driven:
  - 'Page-based: Development and design processes that treats a website as a collection of pages. Not much effort is made to reuse common elements across pages.'
  - 'Tools designed for pages: Tools that focus on displaying documents like Wordpress and Drupal. Backend frameworks such as Rails, Django and PHP that treat UI reuse as an afterthought and discourage widespread component reuse.'
features:
  - Blazing fast hot reload in development
  - Vue components in Markdown
  - Full-text search
  - Support static site generation with `nuxt generate`
  - Powerful QueryBuilder API (MongoDB like)
  - Syntax highlighting to code blocks in markdown files using PrismJS.
  - Table of contents generation
  - Handles Markdown, CSV, YAML, JSON(5), XML
  - Extend with custom parsers
  - Extend with hooks
multiselectOptions:
  - VuePress
  - Gridsome
  - Nuxt

## Git-based Headless CMS

Place files inside the `content/` directory. _Fetch and render `Markdown`, `JSON`, `YAML`, `XML` and `CSV` files through a [MongoDB like API](/fetching)_

## Pages

<list :items="pages" type="info"></list>


## Folder Structure

Some notes about the folder structure with some additional comments on important files.

## Complementary trends

**Design systems**: A holistic approach to user interface design that documents all UI patterns in a centralized system that includes assets (Sketch, Figma, etc.), design principles, governance, and a component library.

**JAMStack**: A methodology for building websites that pre-renders static files and serves them directly from a CDN (as opposed to a server). The UIs of JAMStack sites rely on componentized JavaScript frameworks.

**Agile**: A method of software development that promotes short feedback loops and rapid iteration. Components help teams ship faster by reusing readymade building blocks. That allows agile teams to focus more on adapting to user requirements.
