## Six Thinking Hats

Simple & Effective.

Used with well-defined and explicit Return On Investment success in corporations
worldwide, Six Thinking Hats is a simple, effective parallel thinking process
that helps people be more productive, focused, and mindfully involved. A
powerful tool set, which once learned can be applied immediately!

### How It Works

You and your team members can learn how to separate thinking into six clear
functions and roles. Each thinking role is identified with a colored symbolic
“thinking hat.” By mentally wearing and switching “hats,” you can easily focus
or redirect thoughts, the conversation, or the meeting.

| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| white hat  | The White Hat calls for information known or needed. “The facts, just the facts.”                                                                                                                                            |
| yellow hat | The Yellow Hat symbolizes brightness and optimism. Under this hat you explore the positives and probe for value and benefit.                                                                                                 |
| black hat  | The Black Hat is judgment – the devil’s advocate or why something may not work. Spot the difficulties and dangers; where things might go wrong. Probably the most powerful and useful of the Hats but a problem if overused. |
| red hat    | The Red Hat signifies feelings, hunches and intuition. When using this hat you can express emotions and feelings and share fears, likes, dislikes, loves, and hates.                                                         |
