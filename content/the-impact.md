## CARING FOR VULNERABLE CHILDREN

Over 4500 vulnerable children served by Promise686 and our partners.

### INTERVENING THROUGH CARE COMMUNITIES

Promise686 doesn’t decide whether a child goes into the child welfare
system…that’s up to the state. However, we know when the state does intervene,
it’s time for the Church to intervene. Did you know there are over **400,000
children in the U.S. foster care system** and over **300,00 churches** in
America? That means, **if every church could raise up one foster family, we’d
have enough homes for these vulnerable children**.

**But fostering is a tough job**. Without support, it can feel nearly impossible
to continue. In fact, the national average of families who continue fostering
after their first year is about **50%**, but when supported by a Promise686
Family Advocacy Ministry and its Care Communities, **90% continue fostering**
into a second year.

That’s why we’re on a mission to mobilize churches to create this much-needed
support for foster families. [Our network]() is made up of **over 600 churches &
FAMs** nationwide, each providing the support of Care Communities to roughly
**1800 families in need**.

### CONNECTING CHILDREN WITH FAMILIES THROUGH ADOPTION GRANTS

Since we began in 2007, **Promise686 has awarded $3 million**, helping **350
children and families** connect for a lifetime. **In 2019, we awarded $265, 830
in adoption grants**.

### PREVENTING FOSTER CARE BY PRESERVING FAMILIES

Promise686 implements CarePortal in Georgia, a tool to help churches care for
vulnerable children by meeting the needs of families in crisis. CarePortal is a
technological platform that provides entry-level opportunities to connect a
network of caring people in churches to the physical needs of families in their
community, and has already served **66,758 children**.

This network can provide **preventative support for struggling families before
foster care is a necessity**. In 2019, we launched CarePortal in four new
counties including, Glynn, Carroll, Catoosa & McIntosh. As of July 2020,
CarePortal had created **$853,955** in Georgia economic impact.

In 2019, the Promise686 staff worked with our partners to **train 500 leaders**
across the nation through **31 Advocate Clinics** from coast to coast. These
Clinics equip individuals to create and lead successful FAMs within their local
church.

> “After the clinic, I’m now inspired and determined to get my church involved.
> The material, training, and support offered by your organization make this a
> no-brainer decision.” – Advocate in California

### SERVING VULNERABLE CHILDREN NATIONWIDE

Because of our generous donors, we’re able to continue mobilizing churches
across the country. While we currently serve **289 Georgia churches**, we work
with **27 affiliates in 21 states to serve 609 churches nationwide**.

**This group of churches and affiliates is called [The Promise Network]() and we
work together to implement Family Advocacy Ministries (FAMs)**.
